// Following the steps I've included in the github issue after writing this, go into fn main()…

fn main() {
    println!("my name is car :)");
    println!("you've heard my little song, now I have a constant value to show you!");

    // …and type the following below:
    //  bigmodule::B
    // Backspace the B, and then type B again. Keep doing this repeatedly as quickly as you can, and
    // neovim-gtk will reliably crash.
